Description: Plugins for nagios compatible monitoring systems
 This package provides various plugins for Nagios compatible monitoring
 systems like Nagios and Icinga.
 It contains the following plugins:
 .
   * check_ajp (1): plugin to monitor the AJP ping response time
     Should work with all application servers (Tomcat, JBoss,....)
     which provide an AJPv13 connector.
   * check_backuppc (1.1.0): plugin for checking on the status of
     BackupPC backups
   * check_bgpstate (1.0): plugin to check all BGP session on Cisco routers
   * check_checksums (20130611): plugin to verify file checksums
     against (local, not 100% secure) lists.
     Supports md5 sha1 sha224 sha256 sha384 sha512 checksums.
   * check_clamav (1.2): plugin to check for clamav signature freshness
     This script is used to compare the version and signature
     level of the currently running clamd daemon with the latest
     available versions listed in the TXT record for
     current.cvd.clamav.net.
   * check_cups (0.2): plugin to check queues on a remote CUPS server
     This plugin is monitoring of queues on a remote CUPS server,
     which means that it doesn't need to be installed on the print
     server and run via NRPE.
   * check_drbd (0.5.3): plugin to check DRBD device states
     This plugin is for checking DRBD device states. It parses the
     /proc/drbd device and analyses the output.
   * check_email_delivery (0.7.1b): plugin to monitor email delivery
     Some typical uses of this plugin include:
       - check SMTP server
       - check messages and quota on IMAP server
       - check email delivery loop
       - check auto-responder function
       - keep an eye on email lag
       - monitor automated mailboxes
       - check email-to-FTP or other special email gateways
   * check_etc_hosts (?): plugin to check /etc/hosts for DNS consistency
     Check /etc/hosts, and make sure the content matches the information
     in DNS.  Lookup IP, and check if the names listed in /etc/hosts
     maches the one in DNS.  It will ignore entries with '# NAGIOSIGNORE'
     at the end.
   * check_etc_resolv: plugin to check /etc/resolv.conf
     Check /etc/resolv.conf, and make sure the name servers listed are
     working.  It will ignore entries with '# NAGIOSIGNORE' at the end.
   * check_graphite: Plugin to monitor graphite metrics
   * check_haproxy (rev135): plugin to check the HAProxy statistics url
   * check_haproxy_stats (1.0.1): check haproxy via admin socket
     Different from check_haproxy this plugin is able to check
     haproxy via the unix admin socket.
   * check_hp_bladechassis (1.0.1): plugin to check the hardware health of
     HP blade enclosures via SNMP.
     The plugin is only tested with the c7000 enclosure.
   * check_hpasm (4.7.5.2): plugin to check the hardware health of
     HP Proliant Servers
     It either uses snmp or - if installed - the hpasm package locally.
     The plugin checks the health of
       * Processors
       * Power supplies
       * Memory modules
       * Fans
       * CPU- and board-temperatures
       * Raids
     and alerts you if one of these components is faulty or operates
     outside its normal parameters.
   * check_httpd_status (rev153): plugin checking Apache or Lighthttpd
     server-status page (using mod_status)
   * check_ipmi_sensor (3.12): IPMI Sensor Monitoring Plugin
     Plugin to monitor the hardware status (fan speed, temperaturs,
     voltages, power usage, ...) of a server using IPMI.
   * check_ldap_root (?): plugin to check LDAP server response
     Make sure the LDAP server is able to respond by searching for the
     root DSE.
   * check_libs (0.2015012901 ): plugin to report the usage of no longer existing
     libraries by running processes
   * check_libvirt (v7.0.3): monitor virtualization solutions using libvirt
   * check_lm_sensors (4.1.1): plugin to monitor hardware sensors
     and disk temperatures
   * check_memcached (1.3): plugin to check memcached instances
     It will give a critical message if a partiular memcached host is
     inaccessible and generate a warning if the hit/miss ratio falls
     below a given threshold or the number of evictions exceeds a given
     limit.
     Hit/miss and evictions are measured over a 30 minute interval,
     using a memcached object to store the earlier statistics.
   * check_memory (1.0.1): plugin to check for free memory
     This plugin excludes the system cache and buffer, because
     on some system with very stable memory usage it is perfectly
     normal for system cache to fill in all available memory.
   * check_mongodb (7248618): Plugin script to monitor your MongoDB server(s)
   * check_multipath (0.4.7): plugin to monitor the number of available and
     failed paths of multipath devices
   * check_mysql_health (2.2.2): plugin to check various parameters of a
     MySQL database
   * check_nfsmounts: checks whether there are stale NFS mounts on the host
   * check_printer: plugin to check printer supply levels using SNMP
     It outputs performance data for all supplies
     found, for example toner and drum.
   * check_raid (4.0.5): plugin to check sw/hw RAID status
     The plugin looks for any known types of RAID configurations,
     and checks them all.

     This plugin checks Redis NoSQL database status variables,
     measures its response time and if specified allows one to set thresholds
     on one or more key data. You can set thresholds for data in stats
     variables and some of them are also conveniently available as long options
     with special threshold syntax. Plugin also calculates statistics such as
     Hitrate (calculated as rate of change of hits/misses) and memory use and
     can check replication delay.
   * check_shutdown (0.0.20110203): plugin to detect shutdown in progress
     Report when a reboot is in progress.  This is useful to detect if

     check_smstools is a plugin to monitor a GSM modem
     signal quality and registration status with smstools.
   * check_snmp_environment (0.7): plugin to check various hardware statuses
     Using snmp the plugin is able to retrieve Fan, power-supply,

     Juniper Networks, HP ProCurve, Netscreen, Citrix NetScaler
     and Transmode Systems hardware.
   * check_snmp_time (1.1): plugin to check the time on a server using SNMP
     This plugin queries the remote systems time through SNMP and compares
     it against the local time on the Nagios server. This identifies systems
     with no correct time set and sends alarms if the time is off to far.
     HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemDate.0 used here returns 8 or 11 byte octets.
     SNMP translation needs to be switched off and to be converted the
     received SNMP data into readable strings.

     X.509 certificate
   * check_uptime (0.521): check_uptime returns uptime of a system
     in text (readable) format as well as in minutes for performance graphing.
     The plugin can either run on a local unix system (using 'uptime' command)
     or check remote system by SNMP. Also it is able to report one CRITICAL
     or WARNING alert if system has been rebooted since last check.
   * check_v46 (2013-08-26T07:33:11Z): ipv4/ipv6 Nagios plugin wrapper
     Nagios plugin wrapper for running the actual plugin for both / either of
     IPv6 and/or IPv4.  The worst result of the actual plugin runs will be
     the wrapper return value, that is, result will be OK only if all checks
     returned OK.  Compatible with any plugin with standard command line options
     -6/-4.
   * check_varnish (258c486): plugin to monitor varnish instances
   * check_webinject (1.80): plugin for testing web services
     It uses the WebInject Perl module for automated testing of
     web applications and web services. It can be used to check
     individual system components that have HTTP interfaces
     (JSP, ASP, CGI, PHP, AJAX, Servlets, HTML Forms,
     XML/SOAP Web Services, REST, etc).
   * check_whois (1.21): plugin to check for the expiration of a domain.
     The plugin may not yet work with all registrars, since their
     output formats differ or there is no expiration date in the
     whois output.
   * check_zone_auth (1.13): plugin to ensure that the authoritative nameservers
     for a given zone remain in sync.

       to update the apt database regularly
     * check_running_kernel: check if a system was rebooted after
       a kernel upgrade
     * check_soas: check SOA records
     * check_statusfile: deliver the content of a status file
       as check result

     event/obsession handlers and similar scripts.
   * percona-nagios-plugins (1.1.7): Percona Monitoring Plugins (nagios)
     Nagios MySQL Monitoring plugins writting/provided by Percona.
 .
 Some scripts and binaries need more packages installed to work, which is
 implemented as recommends.
