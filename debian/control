   * check_snmp_time (1.1): plugin to check the time on a server using SNMP
     This plugin queries the remote systems time through SNMP and compares
     it against the local time on the Nagios server. This identifies systems
     with no correct time set and sends alarms if the time is off to far.
     HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemDate.0 used here returns 8 or 11 byte octets.
     SNMP translation needs to be switched off and to be converted the

     or check remote system by SNMP. Also it is able to report one CRITICAL
     or WARNING alert if system has been rebooted since last check.
   * check_v46 (2013-08-26T07:33:11Z): ipv4/ipv6 Nagios plugin wrapper
     Nagios plugin wrapper for running the actual plugin for both / either of
     IPv6 and/or IPv4.  The worst result of the actual plugin runs will be
     the wrapper return value, that is, result will be OK only if all checks
     returned OK.  Compatible with any plugin with standard command line options
     -6/-4.
   * check_webinject (1.80): plugin for testing web services
     It uses the WebInject Perl module for automated testing of
     web applications and web services. It can be used to check
     individual system components that have HTTP interfaces
     (JSP, ASP, CGI, PHP, AJAX, Servlets, HTML Forms,
     XML/SOAP Web Services, REST, etc).
   * check_whois (1.24): plugin to check for the expiration of a domain.
     The plugin may not yet work with all registrars, since their
     output formats differ or there is no expiration date in the
     whois output.
   * check_zone_auth (1.14): plugin to ensure that the authoritative nameservers
     for a given zone remain in sync.
