nagios-plugins-contrib - Plugins for nagios compatible monitoring systems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This README.source should give a short instruction about the
way the pkg-nagios-plugins-contrib repository is structured
and defines basic policies.

* build-system: git-buildpackage. As we build a Debian native
  package pristine-tar is not necessary.

* debian/changelog:
  - preferable generated using git-dch
  - versioning schema: X.$(date '+%Y%m%d'). X will be
    increased by one with each release. In case there are
    bugfixes in stable releases necessary, use
    X.$(date '+%Y%m%d').Y
    See http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/version_numbers/
    for details.

* debian/copyright.in, debian/control.in:
  Base files we fill automatically with information from
  all plugins to generate the full files.
  This is done in the clean target.
  DO NOT MODIFY debian/control or debian/copyright!

* nagios plugins:
  - one directory per plugin
  - required files:
    * $plugin/control: file format similar to debian/control.
      - Required is the Description and Uploaders part.
        Add Build-Depends, Recommends, Suggests
        and Homepage to have their content added to debian/control/
        debian/copyright. Don't use Depends as we don't want to force
        people to install dependencies for a plugin they might not
        want to use.
      - Add Version to be able to track an upstream version of
        the plugin.
      - Add Watch to check for new versions using
        ./debian/packaging-helper.py
        Format:
        Watch URL python-regex
        Watch URL SHA1:sha1sum
      - Don't add empty lines - only the first paragraph will be
        handled.
    * $plugin/copyright: copyright information for the files
      in $plugin. Will be added to debian/copyright
      automatically, properly indented and with a header which
      describes that the coming block is for the files in $plugin.
      ** DEP-5 IS NOT SUPPORTED **
  - what you should have:
    Currently there are two options on how to build and install
    plugins:
    * you have a single script or file or need some hand-made
      build system anyway:
      add $plugin/Makefile and implement the all / install / clean
      targets. include ../common.mk is there for common tasks.
      If $plugin/Makefile exists the way described below *will not*
      be built.
    * your plugin comes with a fancy build system already:
      extract the source in $plugin and let a symlink called 'src'
      point to the subdirectory of $plugin.
      If dh_auto_* is not able to build the plugin, please use
      the Makefile way as described above.
    Please ensure that a proper .cfg file will be installed.
